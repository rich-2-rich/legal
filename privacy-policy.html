    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: December 29, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>I Am Rich 2 ("we," "our," or "the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with your use of our application.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>I Am Rich 2 is designed with privacy in mind. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal information from our users. Specifically:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>We do not collect your name, email address, or any contact information</li>
        <li>We do not track your location</li>
        <li>We do not access your contacts, photos, or other personal data</li>
        <li>We do not use analytics or tracking services</li>
        <li>We do not store any data on our servers</li>
        <li>We do not use cookies or similar tracking technologies</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Purchase Information</h2>
    <p>All purchases, including the initial app purchase and in-app purchases, are processed exclusively through Apple's App Store. We do not have access to your payment information, credit card details, or billing address. Apple's privacy policy governs the collection and use of payment data. Your purchase history is managed by Apple and can be viewed in your App Store account.</p>
    <p>For information about how Apple handles your data, please visit: <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/" target="_blank">Apple's Privacy Policy</a></p>

    <h2>Local Data Storage</h2>
    <p>The App stores the following information locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your membership value and tier status</li>
        <li>Theme preferences</li>
        <li>Notification settings</li>
        <li>Purchase history for feature unlocks</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Remains only on your device</li>
        <li>Is never transmitted to our servers or any third parties</li>
        <li>Is deleted when you uninstall the app</li>
        <li>Can be reset by reinstalling the app</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Notifications</h2>
    <p>If you enable daily affirmation notifications, this preference is stored locally on your device. Notifications are generated locally and do not require any server communication. You can disable notifications at any time through the App's settings or your device's system settings.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or data collection services. The only third-party service involved is Apple's App Store for processing purchases, which is governed by Apple's own privacy policy.</p>

    <h2>Social Sharing</h2>
    <p>The App includes a feature to share affirmations via your device's native sharing functionality. When you choose to share content, the sharing is handled by your device's operating system and the apps you choose to share to. We do not track or store any information about your sharing activity.</p>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our App is not directed to children under the age of 18. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 18. The App requires users to be at least 18 years old to make purchases. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has used the App, please contact us.</p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect or transmit any user data to external servers, there is no user data at risk of external breach. All app functionality and data storage occurs locally on your device, protected by your device's built-in security features.</p>

    <h2>International Users</h2>
    <p>The App does not transfer any data internationally as all data remains on your local device. Apple may process purchase data according to their privacy policy and applicable international data transfer agreements.</p>

    <h2>California Privacy Rights</h2>
    <p>If you are a California resident, you have certain rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). However, since we do not collect, sell, or share any personal information, these rights are not applicable to our App. We do not sell personal information to third parties.</p>

    <h2>European Privacy Rights (GDPR)</h2>
    <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain data protection rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Since we do not collect any personal data, there is no personal data to access, rectify, or erase. Your purchase data is handled by Apple under their GDPR compliance policies.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since we do not collect any personal data, there is no personal data to access, modify, or delete. If you have questions about your App Store purchase data, please contact Apple directly through their support channels.</p>
